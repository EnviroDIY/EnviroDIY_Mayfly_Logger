## Hardware Design Credits

The Mayfly Logger was developed by [Shannon Hicks](https://github.com/s-hicks2) and based on the [SODAQ Mbili board](https://support.sodaq.com/sodaq-one/sodaq-mbili-1284p/) hardware and the [SODAQ Mbili bootloader](https://github.com/SodaqMoja/HardwareMbili) software designed by Gregory Knauff (GKNFF).
