# Simple File Example

This example program demonstrates reading the battery voltage on the LiPo attached to the Mayfly and writing that value to a file on a SD card.

NOTE:  This program is for demonstration only.  It is NOT intended to be used for environmental monitoring.  It does not contain any of the necessary code to allow the Mayfly to sleep and reduce power between readings.
