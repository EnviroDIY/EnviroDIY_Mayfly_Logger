## Programming


Mayfly Data Logger can be programmed using standard Aruduino code and community libraries via the [Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or the more powerful [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) extensions for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

To use the Mayfly with the Arduino IDE you must add "EnviroDIY ATmega Boards" using the Tools > Board > Boards Manager as described in the [Mayfly Data Logger Software](http://envirodiy.org/mayfly/software/) post

No addition set-up is required to use the PlatformIO.
The proper enviroment settings for the Mayfly in a platformio.ini file are:

```ini
[env:mayfly]
platform = atmelavr
board = mayfly
framework = arduino
```
