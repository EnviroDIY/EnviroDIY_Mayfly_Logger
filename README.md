EnviroDIY Mayfly Data Logger
==============
The [EnviroDIY™ Mayfly Data Logger](http://envirodiy.org/mayfly/) is a powerful, user-programmable microprocessor board that is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE software. The goal of the Mayfly Logger project is to enable professional-quality do-it-yourself environmental science and monitoring.

## Getting Started

1. Read [Getting Started With the Mayfly Data Logger](http://envirodiy.org/mayfly/) on the EnviroDIY community website.
2. Purchase an [EnviroDIY Mayfly Data Logger Board](https://www.amazon.com/EnviroDIY-Mayfly-Logger-Arduino-Compatible/dp/B01F9B4WCG) or an [EnviroDIY Mayfly Data Logger Board and Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/EnviroDIY-Mayfly-Arduino-Compatible-Starter/dp/B01FCVALDW) on Amazon.com.
3. Install the [Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) application](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) on your computer; add "EnviroDIY ATmega Boards" using the Tools > Board > Boards Manager as described in the [Mayfly Data Logger Software](http://envirodiy.org/mayfly/software/) post.
4. Clone or [download](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger/archive/master.zip) (and unzip) this entire repository into your Arduino Sketchbook directory, for schematics, and code examples to learn how to program the Mayfly Board.
5. Learn by running the example and workshop code sketches, using the Arduino IDE (from File > Sketchbook), from our [EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger > examples](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger/tree/master/examples) or [EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger > workshop](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/EnviroDIY_Mayfly_Logger/tree/master/workshop) folders.
6. Use our [ModularSensors](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors) code library and other [EnviroDIY libraries on GitHub](https://github.com/EnviroDIY) to deploy solar-powered environmental monitoring stations.
